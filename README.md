# BloomFilter
Problem: Data structure that is able to say whether a given element is located in the database. We would like the data structure to be time and space efficent

Issues: An array with all the elements won't work as this would have a linear time and space complexity. Likewise, a hashtable won't work because it would have a larger than linear space complexity and due to hashing collisions the time complexity won't be constant. 

Solution: A bloom filter uses multiple hash functions that call the element as input and output an index in which would be set to 1 in the bit array. Therefor, when querying for an element, it is unlikely that the hash of an element not in the database would return true. This is based on probability and the number of hashes we have. The more number of filters the better the bloom filter confidence level of it being in the database, but this means that the time complexity would increase and the space complexity would have to also increase. Another thing is that there is no false negatives in bloom filters. There are only false positives from bloom filters and these come from when the query says an element exists when it actually isn't in the database.
